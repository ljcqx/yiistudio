<p>Whoops! Whatever you did just broke the installer! I'm sure that this is just a temporary thing though. Why don't you go back to the previous page and try whatever you did again? Here's a couple ideas to help get you out of this:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Press the "back" button in your browser to go back to the previous page and try whatever action you last performed again.</li>
    <li>Press the button below and let CiiMS figure out what you need to do next.</li>
    <li>If you still get stuck, write down everything you did and submit an issue at <?php echo CHtml::link('github', 'https://github.com/charlesportwoodii/CiiMS/issues'); ?>.</li>
</ul>
